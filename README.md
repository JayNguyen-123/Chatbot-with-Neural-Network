# Chatbot-with-Neural-Network
Chatbots are really helpful these days. Together with Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning chatbots can interact with humans like how humans interact with each other. 
The implementation of chatbots is helpful in many cases from customer support to personal assistants. 
So building your own chatbot for your personal uses or for business makes sense.
The Chatbot works based on DNN(Deep Neural Network) to identify the patterns of sentences given by the user as input and pick a random response related to that query.
